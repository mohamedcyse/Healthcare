#Software Requirements:
Software requirements deal with defining software resource requirements and
prerequisites that need to be installed on a computer to provide optimal functioning of an
application.
These requirements or prerequisites are generally not included in the
software installation package and need to be installed separately before the software is
installed.


#Operating System:
Raspbian is the recommended operating system for normal use on a
Raspberry Pi. It’s a free operating system based on Debian, optimized for
the Raspberry Pi hardware. It comes with over 35,000 packages:
precompiled software bundled in a nice format for easy installation on your
Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is a community project under active development,
with an emphasis on improving the stability and performance of as many
Debian packages as possible.


#Programming Language:
While Python Language Reference describes the exact syntax and
semantics of the Python language, this library reference manual describes
the standard library that is distributed with Python. It also describes some
of the optional components that are commonly included in Python
distributions. Python’s standard library is very extensive, offering a wide
range of facilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed below.
The library contains built-in modules (written in C)that provide access to
system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to
Python programmers, as well as modules, are written in Python that provides
standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday
programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage
and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting away
platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.

#Voice Recognition:
Google Cloud Speech API enables developers to convert audio to
text by applying powerful neural network models in an easy-to-use API.The
API recognizes over 110languages and variants, to support your global user
base. You can transcribe the text of users dictating to an application’s
microphone, enable command-and-control through voice, or transcribe
audio files, among many other use cases. Recognize audio uploaded in the
request, and integrate with your audio storage onGoogle Cloud Storage, by
using the same technology Google uses to power its products.


#Hardware Requirements:

1-Pulse Sensor
The pulse sensor is a plug-and-play heart-rate sensor for microcontrollers and
microcomputers. It essentially combines a simple optical heart rate sensor with
amplification and noise cancellation circuitry making it fast and easy to get reliable
pulse readings.

2-blood pressure Sensor
Automated blood pressure measurement can be a valuable tool in
collecting and documenting this critical information. The blood pressure
sensor has many applications for scientists and engineers. It can be used for
science (engineering) experiments or activity which involves blood
pressure measurements such as in the field of exercise science,biology, physiology, medical engineering, blood pressure anomalies,athletes
comparison, and human health.

3-Body Temperature Sensor
This is a human body temperature sensor. It can be applied to the skin
surface and indicate body temperature after reaching a steady state. The
sensor is accurate and stable and complies with medical certification. It can
be used in many applications such as a child incubators, patient monitoring, and medical research labs.




#System Requirement:

-In this project:
◆Electric wires should be matched to avoid any drop in the robot functionalities. 
◆Spare parts to be used if any damage infects the main parts. 
◆High-performance computer(Raspberry Pi). 
◆The body of the machine should be solid to handle the robot's functions.
◆The appropriate sensors to match with the used board.



#Raspberry Pi 3 is used to communicate with Arduino Uno by converting vocal commands
into text format. 


#PCB used to connect electronic components using conductive tracks.

#Servomotors were used to control the movement of robot's arm (up and down).

#HC-SR04 ultrasonic used to detect and avoid obstacles.
